Introduction
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that allows you to publish and subscribe to streams of records in real-time. It is widely used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

This project aims to give you a simple introduction to Apache Kafka and guide you on how to set it up to post and consume messages.

Installation
To get started with the Apache Kafka Basics project, follow these steps:

Download the Kafka_2.13-3.5.0 project from the official Kafka website.

Extract the downloaded archive to a location of your choice.

Open your terminal and navigate to the kafka_2.13-3.5.0/ directory using the following command:

bash
Copy code
cd kafka_2.13-3.5.0/
Before running Kafka, make sure you have Java installed on your system, as Kafka requires Java to run.

Usage
Now that you have Kafka installed, follow these steps to use the Apache Kafka Basics project:

Start the Zookeeper server using the provided configuration file:

bash
Copy code
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
Start the Kafka server using the provided configuration file:

bash
Copy code
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
To post messages to a topic named "saurabh," use the following command in the terminal:

css
Copy code
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic saurabh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
To consume messages from the "saurabh" topic from the beginning, use the following command:

css
Copy code
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic saurabh --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
Now you can interact with Apache Kafka and see how messages are published and consumed.
